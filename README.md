# [Periodic Table of the Web](https://wwwperiodictable.surge.sh/)
## Map of Web APIs/Technologies
The columns are organized left-to-right by the date an API in that column was first implemented.
The rows are organized by the date they were first proposed.

The first row represents technologies that still work, but are superseded or obsoleted by newer technologies.
The second-to-last row is deprecated or abandoned APIs. These may have been implemented before and removed, or only partly implemented.
The last row is proprietary or vendor-specific APIs. These only ever worked in one browser.

The darkness and lightness represents the browser support of an API.
The redness represents how active an API's proposal or specification is.
## Link format
* Date links to the Specification
* Element abbreviation links to What can this do? (Demo, Playground, or Reference)
* Details links to How can I learn this? Guide
